  <h2>Hey there — I'm Eric Aguayo! welcome to my corner of the web!</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a software developer by trade and an ultra trail runner at heart.
    Whether I’m coding up a new idea or climbing mountain trails, I’m all about
    pushing limits and exploring new frontiers. Right now, I’m working on two
    projects close to my heart: one to help more people dive into the world of
    ultra running, and another to make learning to code more approachable and
    fun. This blog is where I share my journey — from tech experiments to trail
    adventures — and everything in between. If you're into innovation,
    endurance, or just curious about blending code with the great outdoors,
    you're in the right place.
