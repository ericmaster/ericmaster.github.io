		<h1>About</h1>

        <p>My name is Eric Aguayo, I am a software developer and ultra trail runner. 
        I am passionate about technology and the outdoors. I am currently working on a
        project to help people get into ultra running. I am also working on a project to
        help people learn how to code. I am a big fan of the outdoors and I love to run
        in the mountains. I am also a big fan of technology and I love to learn new things.
        I am always looking for new challenges and I am always looking for new ways to
        improve myself.
